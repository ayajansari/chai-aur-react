library vs framework

-> A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use for 
   specific tasks or functionalities.
-> Libraries are typically focused on providing reusable functions, classes, 
   or modules that developers can call directly.
->  In a library, the developer calls the library's code when needed. The control flow
    remains with the developer, who decides when and how to use the library.
->ex. react,jQuery

-> A framework is a comprehensive software infrastructure that provides a structure and 
   predefined components for building applications.
->In a framework, the flow of control is often inverted. The framework calls the code 
  written by the developer, rather than the developer calling the framework.
->ex. bootstrap,spring Django
